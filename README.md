## 1. What's Is Proffy?

üìñ Proffy it's a plataform for connection teachers and students around the world.

**You deserve the best of education, connect with the best teachers in each subject.**

*Proffy* is a cute way of saying "hey teacher" in fundamental schools in Brazil.

## üíª 3. Our Stack

We choose our stack based on the best spaceship üöÄ technologies available.

- TypeScript
- React Native
- Expo
- Express
- SCSS

### Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a great superset for JavaScript, helps us to be more productivity and type safe when development our apps.

### Why React Native?

We use React as our main front-end library for development interfaces,
React Native helps us to transfer our skills across devises, development cross-platform (IOS & Android) apps.

### Why Expo?

Expo it's almost a React Native superset, helps us to build React Natives quickly, without wasting time in configuring every Native API across devices.

### Why Express?

Express it's a Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
It's has a great community support and fills perfect for build REST APIs.

### OK now but WHY SCSS instead of CSS?

Both solutions are great, SCSS helps us to build more productivity and component based stylesheets for your apps without using alternatives like Styled-Components.

## 4. How To Use

```

Now each folder has a subproject, that you can follow the instructions bellow for knowing how to use. Trust me, you don't need to be a alien üëΩ (that's optional, okay?).
